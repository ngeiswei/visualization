Graphics and Visualization Tools
--------------------------------

In addition to the code here,
There is a standalone AtomSpace visualization tool available in the
external-tools repository:

https://github.com/opencog/external-tools/tree/master/AtomViewer

Its probably better than what is here.

Other experimental visualization tools are:

* dotty      -- build a dotty graph of the entire atomspace
* gtk-vistualizer -- use gtk3 to visualize
* tulip      -- dump the AtomSpace to the Tulip tlp graph format

This project needs an active maintainer!
